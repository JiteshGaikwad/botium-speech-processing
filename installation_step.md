## Setting up the tool on a VM on GCP

### Prerequisites (for setting up on GCP):
- GCP account for setting up the VM
- Enable Billing for your project on GCP

### Prerequisites(for setting up on Local system)
- Any OS(Ubuntu, Windows, Mac)
- 8GB RAM
- 40GB free HD space
- Docker 
- Docker-Compose

**Note**: *Since setting up these tools on local system may slow downs the processing of the system, I am setting it up on GCP VM for better performance.*

## Steps to setup the tool
- Step 1: Signup or Signin to your GCP account
- Step 2: [Create a project in the GCP account ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
- Step 3: Now we will create the VM in our newly created Project using Google's [Compute Engine Service](https://cloud.google.com/compute)
